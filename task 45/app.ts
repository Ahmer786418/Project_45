// EXERCISE 45
/*Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should 
always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of
 keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value
 pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure 
all the information was stored   correctly.
